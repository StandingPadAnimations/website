# Mastodon Costs

When I was starting out with my [single-user Mastodon instance](https://mastodon.standingpad.org),
one of the issues that I came across was the lack of information
on what to expect for costs, at least anything recent. Thus, to make
this information easier to find, I'll be publishing the costs
of my Mastodon instance.

Some info about my instance (as of January 2025):

- Software: Mastodon (glitch-soc fork)
- Users: 1 (myself)
- Relays: 9, each for one hashtag
